I was hired to work on a retrospective of Frida Kahloâ€™s work at a major museum. My job was to put together the audio tour, but in order to do that, I needed to create a list of each painting featured in the exhibit, the date it was painted, and its spot in the tour.

I used my knowledge of Python lists to create a master list of each painting, its date, and its audio tour ID.

I completed this project on own computer, using a Jupyter notebook.
