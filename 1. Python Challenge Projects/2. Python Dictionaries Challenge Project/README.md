Overview

This project was slightly different than others I have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project that I built. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and I was expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when I encounter a problem that I could not easily solve.

Project Goals

Work to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.
